# SpaceX

## This project intents to predict whether a rocket will land sucessfully or not.

1. [Collecting Data](https://github.com/hermannvargens/SpaceX/blob/main/jupyter-labs-spacex-data-collection-api.ipynb)  
   In this lab, I did a get request to the SpaceX API. I also did some basic data wrangling and formating.
- Request to the SpaceX API
- Clean the requested data
3. [Web Scrapping](https://github.com/hermannvargens/SpaceX/blob/main/jupyter-labs-webscraping.ipynb)
